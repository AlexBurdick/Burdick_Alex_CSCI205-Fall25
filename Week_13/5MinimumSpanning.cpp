Often it would be nice to have an algorithm that, for any connected vertices and 
edges, would remove any extra edges. The result would be a graph with the minimum 
number of edges necessary to connect the vertices. For example, Figure a) shows five 
vertices with an excessive number of edges, while Figure b) shows the same vertices 
with the minimum number of edges necessary to connect them. This constitutes a 
minimum spanning tree (MST). Sketch the MST from the following graph using Prim’s 
algorithm and determine the “cost”.
Implement Prim’s algorithm using the Graph.h and Vertex.h classes and demonstrate 
that your solution is correct.
